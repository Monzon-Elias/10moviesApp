# 10movies
Instructions: 
Access the link to use the app: https://monzon-elias.github.io/10moviesApp/index.html. 

Observations: 
Knowing that my time was going to run down if I started studying Vue and Nuxt, which are tools I never used, 
I spent the time exploiting my strengths. 
I did a nice responsive design with cards and used vanilla JavaScript for the application behavior. 
Each movie is shown on a card with a limit of 10 cards on the screen, as I limit the number of results to 10 when I call the TMDB API. 

Next steps: 
I wanted to incorporate a paging feature but did not have the time. That is a priority in a second version.
