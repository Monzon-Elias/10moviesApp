# 10movies
Instructions: Simply access the link to use the app. 
Observations: Knowing that my time was going to run down if I started studying Vue and Nuxt, which are tools I never used, I spent the time exploiting my strengths. 
I did a responsive design with cards and used vanilla JavaScript for the application behavior. 
Each movie is shown on a card with a limit of 10 cards on the screen, as I limit the number of results to 10 when I call the TMDB API. 
Next steps: I wanted to incorporate a paging feature, but did not have the time. That is a priority in a second version.
